# Glomerulus segmentation in large kidney images
## Study process
1. Make Pre-trained model (using HuBMAP dataset)
    - Make config file (mmdet format) & fine tuning the detection and segmentation model
    - Compare single class(only glomerulus) model with multi class(plus alpha) model
3. 
### Glomerulus segmentation result (Kaggle HuBMAP Competition Dataset)
